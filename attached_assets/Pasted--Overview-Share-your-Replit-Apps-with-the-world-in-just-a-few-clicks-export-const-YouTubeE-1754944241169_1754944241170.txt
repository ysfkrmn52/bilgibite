Replit Deployments lets you publish your Replit App to the cloud using a simplified process.

## What is Replit Deployments?

Replit Deployments is a feature that saves a **snapshot** of your Replit App to the cloud,
where it everyone can interact with it. A snapshot captures the current state of the files in your
Replit App.

When you deploy your Replit App, you create a **deployment**. A deployment is a running instance
of your app on Replit's cloud infrastructure. This makes the app reliably available on the internet,
separate from the version in your workspace.

<Info>
  Replit's infrastructure is backed by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). All deployments are hosted in the United States.

Replit Deployments includes tools to monitor your deployment status and view web analytics.

Replit offers the following deployment types:

  <Card title="Static Deployments" href="/cloud-services/deployments/static-deployments" icon="files">
    Provides an affordable way to host websites that don't change based on user input.

  <Card title="Reserved VM Deployments" href="/cloud-services/deployments/reserved-vm-deployments" icon="server">
    Provides a consistent amount of computing resources for your app to run continuously.

  <Card title="Scheduled Deployments" href="/cloud-services/deployments/scheduled-deployments" icon="clock">
    Runs your app at scheduled times that you choose.

</CardGroup>

## Getting started

Follow the steps below to deploy your Replit App:

1. From your Replit App workspace, select <img class="icon-svg" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/icons/deploy-icon.svg" alt="Deployment icon" /> **Deploy** at the top.
2. In the **Deployments** tab, select your deployment option.
3. If **Add a payment method** appears, follow the prompts to add a payment method.

Replit automatically selects the best deployment option for your app based on the project type and your needs.

However, to choose a different deployment type, consider the following information.

## Choosing the right deployment option

The following video explains how to choose the right deployment option for your app:

</Frame>

## Key features

Deployments offer the following convenient features:

* **Multiple deployment types**: Select or update a deployment type that meets your needs in a few clicks.
* **Custom domains**: Serve your app from your web domain.
* **Analytics**: Track visitor data and other metrics for your deployed app.
* **Monitoring tools**: View your app's deployment status and configuration.
* **Access controls**: Control who can see your app with a single click. Available only for **Teams** members.

## How it works

When you deploy your Replit App, Replit creates a snapshot of your app's files and dependencies.
This snapshot is then sent to Replit's cloud infrastructure, where it runs as a separate instance of your app.
To update your deployment with the latest changes, deploy again to create a fresh snapshot.

<Warning>
  Avoid saving and relying on data written to a deployed app's filesystem. To store data, use a storage or database option such as Replit's [Storage and Database](/category/storage-and-databases) offerings.
</Warning>

## Use cases

The following examples show different types of Replit Deployments.

### Autoscale deployment: Typing speed assessment app

Let the cloud scale up resources when users take typing tests and reduce them when not in use.

### Static deployment: Solar system simulation

Learn about the planets in a solar system visualization app on the web.
This visualization renders in the browser and doesn't transfer any user input to a server.

### Reserved VM deployment: Discord bot

Run a Discord bot that helps you moderate and onboard members.
It's always online to chat with users and respond to commands with predictable pricing and performance.

### Scheduled deployment: Home automation triggers

Schedule API calls to start and stop your smart home devices at specific times and days.
